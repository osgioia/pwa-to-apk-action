> Github Action for Converting your PWA to android app.

### ‚ú® [Demo](https://github.com/sharadcodes/pwa-to-apk-action-test)

## How to use?
To use this action add following to your workflow file

```yml
- name: PWA to APK action
  uses: sharadcodes/pwa-to-apk-action@v1.0.0
  with:
    project-root-folder: 'your_android_project_folder_root' # This should be the root folder which contains
                                                            # all the files generated by bubblewrap-cli
```

## What about the Future?
Well I'm planning to remove the extra step in which you have to upload the android project folder generated by bubblewrap-cli in the next release of this action so stay tuned by watching the repo :), a star will also do a fine job.
